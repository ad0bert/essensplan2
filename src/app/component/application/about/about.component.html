        <p>We created this Privacy Policy (version 01.01.1970-121340020), to declare which information we collect, how
            we use data and which options the users of our website have, according to the guidelines of the <a

        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature, but we have put much effort into
            describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.</p>
        <h2 id="automatische-datenspeicherung-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Automatic Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and saved, just as it
            happens on this website.</p>
        <p>Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website
            is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as</p>
        <ul class="adsimple-121340020">
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">browser and browser version</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">the used operating system</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from

        </ul>
        <p>in files (webserver-logfiles).</p>
        <p>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically. We do not pass
            this information to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data will be looked at in case
            of illegal conduct.</p>
        <h2 id="cookies-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Cookies</h2>
        <p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br />
            For your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what
            cookies are and why they are in use.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What exactly are cookies?</h3>
        <p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser. Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
            Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are
            called cookies.</p>
        <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use
            cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other
            uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are
            automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a
            name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>
        <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you
            re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to
            cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers
            every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>
        <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
            site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is
            individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can
            be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses,
            trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p>
        <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">name:</strong> _ga<br />
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121340020-9<br />
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br />
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>
        <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
        <ul class="adsimple-121340020">
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">at least 50 cookies per domain</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">at least 3000 cookies in total</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
        <p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of
            the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>
        <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">Essential Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user
            for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes
            back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these
            cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>
        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">Purposive Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any
            error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within
            different browsers.</p>
        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">Target-orientated Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered
            locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>
        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">Advertising Cookies<br />
            </strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering
            individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>
        <p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept.
            Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete cookies?</h3>
        <p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website
            cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore,
            you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>
        <p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to
            your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>

        <p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you
            whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either
            permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser.
            Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you
            could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.
        </p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How is my data protected?</h3>
        <p>There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires
            the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed
            reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act
            (TKG).</p>
        <p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a

        <p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested

        <p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your

        <p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been
            published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?</h3>
        <p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server.
            Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts
            are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use
            of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times.
            Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors
            in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort
            parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no
            cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari,
            Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems,
            including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire
            online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Which data is saved by Google?</h3>
        <p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data
            gets transferred to Google’s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address)
            is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of
            end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for
            „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.</p>
        <p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its
            collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the
            results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own
            web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google
            Fonts’ BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google’s webservice BigQuery to be able to
            inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>
        <p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits
            information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser’s screen
            resolution and name to Google’s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google
            has not directly declared it.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
        <p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located
            outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the
            help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>
        <p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google’s aim is to fundamentally
            boost websites’ loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered
            after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes
            Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the
            design.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?</h3>
        <p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data
            is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact
            Google’s support at <a class="adsimple-121340020"

            The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p>
        <p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of
            font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers

            Policy</h2>
        <p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA
            94043, USA).<br />
            We integrated Google Fonts locally, so on our own webserver and not on Google’s servers. Hence, there is no
            connection to Google’s servers and consequently no data transfer or retention.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What are Google Fonts?</h3>
        <p>Google Fonts was previously called Google Web Fonts. It is an interactive list with over 800 fonts which <a

            offer for free use. With the use of Google Fonts, it is possible to utilise fonts without uploading them to
            your own server. For that matter, in order to prevent any transfer of information to Google’s servers, we
            downloaded the fonts to our own server. This way we comply with the data privacy and do not transmit any
            data to Google Fonts.</p>

        <h2 id="google-tag-manager-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Google Tag Manager Privacy
            Policy</h2>
        <p>We use Google Tag Manager by the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA)
            for our website.<br />
            This Tag Manager is one of Google’s many helpful marketing products. With it, we can centrally integrate and
            manage code sections of various tracking tools, that we use on our website.</p>
        <p>In this privacy statement we will explain in more detail, what Google Tag Manager does, why we use it and to
            what extent your data is processed.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What is Google Tag Manager?</h3>
        <p>Google Tag Manager is an organising tool with which we can integrate and manage website tags centrally and
            via a user interface. Tags are little code sections which e.g. track your activities on our website. For
            this, segments of JavaScript code are integrated to our site’s source text. The tags often come from
            Google’s intern products, such as Google Ads or Google Analytics, but tags from other companies can also be
            integrated and managed via the manager. Since the tags have different tasks, they can collect browser data,
            feed marketing tools with data, embed buttons, set cookies and track users across several websites.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Why do we use Google Tag Manager for our website?</h3>
        <p>Everybody knows: Being organised is important! Of course, this also applies to maintenance of our website. In
            order to organise and design our website as well as possible for you and anyone who is interested in our
            products and services, we rely on various tracking tools, such as Google Analytics.<br />
            The collected data shows us what interests you most, which of our services we should improve, and which
            other persons we should also display our services to. Furthermore, for this tracking to work, we must
            implement relevant JavaScript Codes to our website. While we could theoretically integrate every code
            section of every tracking tool separately into our source text, this would take too much time and we would
            lose overview. This is the reason why we use Google Tag Manager. We can easily integrate the necessary
            scripts and manage them from one place. Additionally, Google Tag Manager’s user interface is easy to
            operate, and requires no programming skills. Therefore, we can easily keep order in our jungle of tags.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What data is saved by Google Tag Manager?</h3>
        <p>Tag Manager itself is a domain that neither uses cookies nor stores data. It merely functions as an
            “administrator“ of implemented tags. Data is collected by the individual tags of the different web analysis
            tools. Therefore, in Google Tag Manager the data is sent to the individual tracking tools and does not get
            saved.</p>
        <p>However, with the integrated tags of different web analysis tools such as Google Analytics, this is quite
            different. Depending on the analysis tool used, various data on your internet behaviour is collected, stored
            and processed with the help of cookies. Please read our texts on data protection for more information on the
            articular analysis and tracking tools we use on our website.</p>
        <p>We allowed Google via the account settings for the Tag Manager to receive anonymised data from us. However,
            this exclusively refers to the use of our Tag Manager and not to your data, which are saved via code
            sections. We allow Google and others, to receive selected data in anonymous form. Therefore, we agree to the
            anonymised transfer of our website data. However, even after extensive research we could not find out what
            summarised and anonymous data it is exactly that gets transmitted. What we do know is that Google deleted
            any info that could identify our website. Google combines the data with hundreds of other anonymous website
            data and creates user trends as part of benchmarking measures. Benchmarking is a process of comparing a
            company’s results with the ones of competitors. As a result, processes can be optimised based on the
            collected information.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How long and where is the data saved?</h3>
        <p>When Google stores data, this is done on Google’s own servers. These servers are located all over the world,
            with most of them being in America. At <a class="adsimple-121340020"

            detail where Google’s servers are.</p>
        <p>In our individual data protection texts on the different tools you can find out how long the respective
            tracking tools save your data.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
        <p>Google Tag Manager itself does not set any cookies but manages different tracking websites’ tags. In our data
            protection texts on the different tracking tools you can find detailed information on how you can delete or
            manage your data.</p>
        <p>Google actively participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates safe transfer of
            personal data. You can find more information at <a class="adsimple-121340020"

        <p>We use selected Facebook tools on our website. Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook
            Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can
            provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services. In the following
            we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook
            and how you can delete these data.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What are Facebook tools?</h3>
        <p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s
            official name for the tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook
            tools”. They include the following:</p>
        <ul class="adsimple-121340020">
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">Facebook-Pixel</li>

            <li class="adsimple-121340020">Technologies and Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities
            outside of Facebook.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
        <p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help
            of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable
            adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore,
            information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook.
            Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products
            or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p>
        <p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services.
            That way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf.
            Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products.
            Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins
            for instance, you can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What data is saved by the Facebook tools?</h3>
        <p>With the use of the Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the
            tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p>
        <p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member).
            However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means,
            that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of
            encrypting data.</p>
        <p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we
            receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what
            products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as
            advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event
            data“ can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts.
            Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p>
        <p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other
            data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of
            security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies.
            Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the
            tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your
            browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook
            cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a
                class="adsimple-121340020" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=121340020"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How long and where are the data saved?</h3>
        <p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products.
            Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within
            48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
        <p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information,
            rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p>
        <p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your
            Facebook account works as follows:</p>

        <h2 id="facebook-soziale-plug-ins-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Facebook Social Plugins
            Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We installed so-called social plugins from Facebook Inc. to our website. You can recognise these buttons by
            the classic Facebook logo, the “Like” button (hand with raised thumb) or by a “Facebook plugin” label. A
            social plugin is a small part of Facebook that is integrated into our page. Each plugin has its own
            function. The most used functions are the well-known “Like” and “Share” buttons.</p>
        <p>Facebook offers the following social plugins:</p>
        <ul class="adsimple-121340020">
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">“Save” button</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">“Like” button, Share, Send and Quote</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">Page plugin</li>
            <li class="adsimple-121340020">Comments</li>

                rel="noopener">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins</a> you will find more information on how
            the individual plugins are used. On the one hand, we use the social plug-ins to offer you a better user
            experience on our site, and on the other hand because Facebook can optimise our advertisements with it.</p>
        <p>If you have a Facebook account or have already visited <a class="adsimple-121340020"
                href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">facebook.com</a>, Facebook has
            already placed at least one cookie in your browser. In this case, your browser sends information to Facebook
            via this cookie as soon as you visit our website or interact with social plugins (e.g. the “Like” button).
        </p>
        <p>The received information will be deleted or anonymised within 90 days. According to Facebook, this data
            includes your IP address, the websites you have visited, the date, time and other information relating to
            your browser.</p>
        <p>In order to prevent Facebook from collecting much data and matching it with your Facebook data during your
            visit to our website, you must log out of Facebook while you visit our website.</p>
        <p>If you are not logged in to Facebook or do not have a Facebook account, your browser sends less information
            to Facebook because you have fewer Facebook cookies. Nevertheless, data such as your IP address or which
            website you are visiting can be transmitted to Facebook. We would like to explicitly point out that we do
            not know what exact data is collected. However, based on our current knowledge, we want to try informing you
            as best we can about data processing. You can also read about how Facebook uses the data in the company’s

        <h2 id="instagram-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Instagram Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We have integrated functions of Instagram to our website. Instagram is a social media platform of the company
            Instagram LLC, 1601 Willow Rd, Menlo Park CA 94025, USA. Since 2012, Instagram is a subsidiary company of
            Facebook Inc. and is a part of Facebook’s products. The inclusion of Instagram’s contents on our website is
            called embedding. With this, we can show you Instagram contents such as buttons, photos or videos directly
            on our website. If you open websites of our online presence, that have an integrated Instagram function,
            data gets transmitted to, as well as stored and processed by Instagram. Instagram uses the same systems and
            technologies as Facebook. Therefore, your data will be processed across all Facebook firms.</p>
        <p>In the following, we want to give you a more detailed insight on why Instagram collects data, what data these
            are and how you can control data processing. As Instagram belongs to Facebook Inc., we have, on the one hand
            received this information from the Instagram guidelines, and on the other hand from Facebook’s Data Policy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What is Instagram?</h3>
        <p>Instagram is one of the most famous social media networks worldwide. Instagram combines the benefits of a
            blog with the benefits of audio-visual platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. To “Insta“ (how the platform is
            casually called by many users) you can upload photos and short videos, edit them with different filters and
            also share them to other social networks. Also, if you do not want to be active on Instagram yourself, you
            can just follow other interesting users.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Why do we use Instagram on our website?</h3>
        <p>Instagram is a social media platform whose success has skyrocketed within recent years. Naturally, we have
            also reacted to this boom. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible on our website. Therefore, we
            attach great importance to diversified contents. With the embedded Instagram features we can enrich our
            content with helpful, funny or exciting Instagram contents. Since Instagram is a subsidiary company of
            Facebook, the collected data can also serve us for customised advertising on Facebook. Hence, only persons
            who are genuinely interested in our products or services can see our ads.</p>
        <p>Instagram also uses the collected data for tracking and analysis purposes. We receive summarised statistics
            and therefore more insight to your wishes and interests. It is important to mention that these reports do
            not identify you personally.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What data is saved by Instagram?</h3>
        <p>Whenever you land on one of our sites, which have Instagram functions (i.e. Instagram photos or plugins)
            integrated to them, your browser automatically connects with Instagram’s servers. Thereby, data is sent to,
            as well as saved and processed by Instagram. This always happens, whether you have an Instagram account or
            not. Moreover, it includes information on our website, your computer, your purchases, the advertisements you
            see and on how you use our offer. The date and time of your interaction is also stored. If you have an
            Instagram account or are logged in, Instagram saves significantly more data on you.</p>
        <p>Facebook distinguishes between customer data and event data. We assume this is also the case for Instagram.
            Customer data are for example names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses. These data are only
            transmitted to Instagram, if they have been “hashed” first. Thereby, a set of data is transformed into a
            string of characters, which encrypts any contact data. Moreover, the aforementioned “event data“ (data on
            your user behaviour) is transmitted as well. It is also possible, that contact data may get combined with
            event data. The collected data data is matched with any data Instagram already has on you.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the gathered data are transferred to Facebook via little text files (cookies) which usually get
            set in your browser. Depending on the Instagram function used, and whether you have an Instagram account
            yourself, the amount of data that gets stored varies.</p>
        <p>We assume data processing on Instagram works the same way as on Facebook. Therefore, if you have an account
            on Instagram or have visited <a class="adsimple-121340020" href="http://www.instagram.com?tid=121340020"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.instagram.com</a>, Instagram has set at least one cookie. If this is
            the case, your browser uses the cookie to send information to Instagram, as soon as you come across an
            Instagram function. No later than 90 days (after matching) the data is deleted or anonymised. Even though we
            have studied Instagram’s data processing in-depth, we cannot tell for sure what exact data Instagram
            collects and retains.</p>
        <p>In the following we will show you a list of the least cookies placed in your browser when click on an
            Instagram function (e.g. button or an Insta picture). In our test we assume you do not have an Instagram
            account, since if you would be logged in to your Instagram account, your browser would place significantly
            more cookies.<br />
            The following cookies were used in our test:</p>

        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How long and where are these data stored?</h3>
        <p>Instagram shares the information obtained within the Facebook businesses with external partners and persons
            you are globally connected with. Data processing is done according to Facebook’s internal data policy. Your
            data is distributed to Facebook’s servers across the world, partially for security reasons. Most of these
            servers are in the USA.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
        <p>Thanks to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of information, rectification,
            transfer and deletion of your data. Furthermore, you can manage your data in Instagram’s settings. If you
            want to delete your data on Instagram completely, you will have to delete your Instagram account
            permanently.</p>
        <p>And this is how an Instagram account can be deleted:</p>
        <p>First, open the Instagram app. Then, navigate to your profile page, select the three bars in the top right,
            choose “Settings” and then click “Help”. Now, you will be redirected to the company’s website, where you
            must click on “Managing Your Account” and then “Delete Your Account”.</p>
        <p>When you delete your account completely, Instagram deletes posts such as your photos and status updates. Any
            information other people shared about you are not a part of your account and do therefore not get deleted.
        </p>
        <p>As mentioned before, Instagram primarily stores your data via cookies. You can manage, deactivate or delete
            these cookies in your browser. Depending on your browser, managing them varies a bit. We will show you the
            instructions of the most relevant browsers here.</p>

        <h2 id="twitter-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121340020">Twitter Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We have incorporated Twitter functions on our website. These are, for example, embedded tweets, timelines,
            buttons or hashtags. Twitter is a short message service and social media platform from the firm Twitter
            Inc., One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2 D02 AX07, Ireland.</p>
        <p>To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the Twitter function
            does not transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to Twitter. Only when you interact
            with the Twitter functions, such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to Twitter and get saved as
            well as processed there. We have no influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility
            for it. Within this privacy statement, we want to give you an overview of what data Twitter stores, what
            Twitter does with this data and how you can largely protect yourself from data transmission.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What is Twitter?</h3>
        <p>For some, Twitter is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a
            microblogging service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.</p>
        <p>Both individuals as well as companies use Twitter for communicating with interested people via short
            messages. Twitter only allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called “tweets”. In contrast to
            Facebook, for example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of “friends”, but strives to
            be regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On Twitter you can also have an anonymous account and
            tweets can be deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">Why do we use Twitter on our website?</h3>
        <p>Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and
            communicating with our customers. Twitter is a truly useful “small” news service, which is why it has grown
            dear to us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do
            not have the time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That
            is why we also have integrated Twitter functions to our website. That way, you can experience our Twitter
            activities “on site” or come to our Twitter page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to
            strengthen the service and user-friendliness on our website.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">What data is stored by Twitter?</h3>
        <p>You will find integrated Twitter functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with Twitter content,
            such as by clicking a button, Twitter may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don’t have a
            Twitter account yourself. Twitter calls this data “log data”. It includes demographic data, browser cookie
            IDs, your smartphone’s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on
            Twitter and what actions you have taken there. Of course, Twitter stores more data if you have a Twitter
            account and are logged in. This retention is usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are
            usually set in your browser and transmit various information to Twitter.</p>
        <p>We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to Twitter but visit a website with
            built-in Twitter functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be
            extensive, since the array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with Twitter
            content.<br />
            The following cookies have been used in our test:</p>

        <p>
            <strong class="adsimple-121340020">Note: </strong>Twitter also works with third parties. Therefore, we have
            recognized the three Google Analytics cookies _ga, _gat, _gid in our test.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, Twitter uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to
            improve their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal
            security measures.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
        <p>When Twitter collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarized
            or otherwise concealed. Twitter’s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly,
            it can be assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could
            not clearly determine whether Twitter also owns servers in Europe. Generally, Twitter may keep collected
            data stored until either the data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a
            potential legal deletion period has been reached.</p>
        <h3 class="adsimple-121340020">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
        <p>In their Privacy Policy, Twitter repeatedly emphasize that they do not save data from external website
            visits, provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you
            interact directly with Twitter, the company will of course store your data.</p>
        <p>If you have a Twitter account, you can manage your data by clicking on “More” under the “Profile” button.
            Then click on “Settings and privacy”. Here you can manage data processing individually.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a Twitter account, you can go to <a class="adsimple-121340020"
                href="https://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a> and click “Settings”. At “Personalization and data” you can
            manage data that is collected on you.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, most data are stored via cookies, which you can manage, deactivate or delete in your
            browser. Please note that when changing cookie settings in your browser, the edits will only affect that
            very browser. This means that if you use another browser in the future, you will have to manage your cookie
            settings there again. In the following you will find instructions for managing cookies in the most popular
            browsers.</p>
